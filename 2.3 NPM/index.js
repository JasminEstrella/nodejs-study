/** NPM 
 * 
 * it's basically a place which collects modules that people have built for Node
 * It's open source and you can search to find all the packages that other developers have created, little
 * tools that they've written the code for, that they think might be useful for other developers in the
 * future, so that you don't have to duplicate the work and to write everything from scratch.
 * So it's our shared code library, if you will.
